- It stands for common table expression
- It is used to define a subquery block which can be referenced within the main query
- we use this immediately after we create it.

code:
```sql
with cte_example as
(
	select gender, avg(salary) avg_sal, max(salary) max_sal, min(salary) min_sal, count(salary) count_sal
	from employee_demographics dem
	join employee_salary sal
	on dem.employee_id = sal.employee_id
	group by gender
)
select avg(avg_sal)
from cte_example;
```

This code will give avg salary of average of male and average of female

output:

we can also do the above code using subquery

```sql
select avg(avg_sal)
from (
select gender, avg(salary) avg_sal, max(salary) max_sal, min(salary) min_sal, count(salary) count_sal 
from employee_demographics dem
join employee_salary sal
on dem.employee_id = sal.employee_id
group by gender
) example_subquery
```


## defining multiple cte


```sql
with cte_example as
(
 select emloyee_id, gender, birth_date
 from employee_demographics
 where birth_date > '1985-01-01'
),
cte_example2 as
(
	select employee_id, salary
	from employee_salary
	where salary > 50000
)
select *
from cte_example 
join cte_example2
on cte_example.employee_id = cte_example2.employee_id
```




### overwriting the column name using cte


```sql
with cte_example (Gender, Avg_sal, Max_Sal, MIn_sal, Count_sal) as
(
 select emloyee_id, gender, birth_date
 from employee_demographics
 where birth_date > '1985-01-01'
),
cte_example2 as
(
	select employee_id, salary
	from employee_salary
	where salary > 50000
)
select *
from cte_example 
join cte_example2
on cte_example.employee_id = cte_example2.employee_id
```
