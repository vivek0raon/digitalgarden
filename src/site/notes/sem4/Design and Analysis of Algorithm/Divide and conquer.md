## Break it into subproblem and find the solution and combine the solution

### What every the problem is subproblem will be also same problem

#### If the problem is sort subproblem will also be sort

##### This is recursive in nature

### How to write divide and conquer

#### You should have solution for smaller problem
##### Divide the P into multiple subpart then solve it 
###### Then combine it
